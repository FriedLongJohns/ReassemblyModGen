# ReassemblyModGen
A garbage attempt at creating randomized mods for the game Reassembly.

Main.py generates a full blocks.lua for a faction, with a core, weapons, hull, thrusters, and unique blocks that are fully random.
Can't create many, many things (EX: Shrouds or Frags) but it's pretty good for how long it took to make it.

Simply download the files and `python3 main.py` in your local terminal.
It'll prompt you if you want to save the data it generates or not in a file, so that you can deny REALLY bad factions.
